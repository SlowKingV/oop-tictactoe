# Object Oriented Programming (Ruby): Tic Tac Toe
> In this project, the student builds a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Run the game

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
    - You need to have ***Ruby*** installed on your machine ([Check this out](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for instructions on installing ruby)

### Usage
    To run the code go to `/bin` inside your cloned repo and run `$ main.rb` in the terminal. The main file will search automatically for your **Ruby environement** inside `/usr/bin/env`. If it can't find ruby there then you can either use ruby to load the file (`$ ruby main.rb`) or modify the first line inside `main.rb` with the path where you have Ruby installed.

    *Optional*: You can create a softlink to your **$PATH** so you can run the game without having to navigate to its local folder. To do this make sure you still are in `/bin/` inside the repo folder, then use the command: `$ ln -s $PWD/main.rb /usr/local/bin` to create the softlink (if the directory doesn't exist you can create it using `$ mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/`), then navigate to the link directory and rename it with anything you want like 'tictactoe' (`$ mv main.rb tictactoe`, the link doesn't needs the extension **.rb** anymore), remember that this changes apply only to the link inside `/usr/local/bin` and not the repo folder. Once you finish you can run the game whenever you want just using the link's name (e.g. `$ tictactoe`).
