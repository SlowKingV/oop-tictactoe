# Advanced Building Blocks - Bubble Sort
> In this project, you will implement the bubble sort algorithm.

The bubble sort algorithm consist in comparing two entries from a given array and, in case the next entry is greater than the previous, switch their positions. This process will keep repeating until all of the values are sorted in ascending order.

## Built With

- Ruby
- VSCode


## Getting Started

**To get a local copy of this project you can either clone or copy the contents of the file that you want.**
**There are no dependencies and therefore each Ruby file (`.rb`) is standalone from each other**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
    - You need to have ***Ruby*** installed on your machine ([Check this out](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for instructions on installing ruby)

### Usage
    To run the code go to the local folder where you have the *Ruby file* and run in the terminal `$ ruby file.rb` being 'file' the one you want to run

### Run tests
    - On the first method (`:bubble_sort`) you can change the given array where you call the method (just after the method definition).
    - On the second one (`:bubble_sort_by`) you can change the words inside the array (remember to separate them with spaces).
